# Code development during your project

Regardless of what your project scope is, you will need to write code. Importantly, the code is therefore a critical
part of your project. This section will provide you with some guidance on how to manage your code development during
your project.

## Version control

> Code not tracked by version control is code that does not exist.

Yeah, I know that is technically not true, but it is a good rule of thumb. Version control is such a critical part of
code development that it is hard to overstate its importance. Version control allows you to track changes to your code
over time, collaborate with others and manage different versions of your code. There are many version control systems
available, but the most popular one is [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). For hosting your code, you can either
use [Github](https://github.com/) or DTU computes [Gitlab](https://lab.compute.dtu.dk) instance.

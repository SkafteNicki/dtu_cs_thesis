# The defense

Yeah, you are nearly there. You handed in the thesis and you are only missing the defense. But what are the actual
rules and format? Here is a short overview:

The defense is a 1 hour examination of your project where you supervisor, co-supervisors if any, and a censor will
be present. You are free to invite friends and family to the defense. The format is usually like this:

1. 20-25 min presentation of your project. You simply create a power-point or similar and present what you have done
    throughout the project. You should more or less follow the structure of the thesis, but I would recommend that you
    focus more on the parts of the project that is truly your work. By this I mean that you should not spend too much
    time on the motivation and background but instead of your results and discussion. If you have a product to show,
    like a demo of some software you have written, this should be included in the presentation.

2. 20-25 min of questions from censor and supervisor. Do not think of this part of the defense as a test. It is more
    like a discussion where you either get questions to elaborate on your work or you get questions that are meant to
    challenge your work. This is very much a discussion instead of you just answering questions.

3. 10 min of grading. You (together with friends and family) will be asked to leave the room and you need to take all
    your belongings with you. Supervisor and censor then discuss what grade you should get. As a rule of thumb you can
    expect that the majority of the grade is based on your report and the presentation is often used to determine which
    grade you should get if you are on the edge between two grades.

4. You get pulled in (without friends and family) and you are told the grade. You will most likely be given some
    feedback for you to understand why you got the grade you got.

That's it. You are now either a Bachelor or a Master of Science. Congratulations!

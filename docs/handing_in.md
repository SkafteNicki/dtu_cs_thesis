Your thesis should be handed in as a single `.pdf` document on Campusnet <https://campusnet.dtu.dk> where you under the
"Assignments" tab should the thesis assignment (called "Project").

!!! warning "Confidentiality"

    If your thesis is confidential for any given reason, you should check-off the box saying

    ```
    [ ] There is NDA or confidentiality agreement in place for this project
    ```

    on the handin page and make sure the box saying

    ```
    [ ] Upload thesis to DTU library
    ```

    is not checked. This will make sure that the thesis is not published in the DTU  library afterwards. If you are not
    sure if your thesis is confidential, you should ask your supervisor.

You will **not** be receiving a confirmation email when you hand in your thesis, but your supervisor will be notified
within a couple of hours. After the deadline has passed, your supervisor will send your thesis to the examiners.

## 📎 Appendix

In addition to the appendix you may have in the `.pdf` file of your thesis you have the option to upload supporting
files as part of the thesis hand-in. Consider including:

* **Source code** – If possible, make your implementation accessible through platforms like GitHub or as a
    well-organized archive
* **Executable applications** – Provide ready-to-run binaries or applications that can be installed and tested
    immediately
* **Research datasets** – Include any datasets you've collected, generated, or curated during your study
* **Analysis workflows** – Share computational notebooks (Jupyter, R Markdown) or scripts (MATLAB, Python) used for
    data analysis
* **Design documentation** – Compile design artifacts such as prototypes, wireframes, mockups, or visual materials
    (e.g., Figma designs)
* **Demonstration materials** – Provide videos or interactive demos that showcase your application or research
    methodology

If you upload multiple files, consider compressing them into a single `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive for easier handling.
Add a clear README file to explain the contents and how to use them. A poorly organized collection of files diminishes
the impact of your work. Structure and document everything professionally.

!!! note "Re-submission of project plan and self-evaluation"

    One document that you need to add as appendix when handing in your thesis, is a updated version of your project
    plan. You should essentially add a section that lays if any parts of the project have changed significantly from
    when you handed-in the original plan. In addition, you are also required to add another section where you
    self-evaluate the project process e.g.

    * Did you follow the timeplan?
    * Did we work well together as a group (if applicable)?
    * What problems did we encounter during the project
    * Was there any problem with the company involved (if applicable)

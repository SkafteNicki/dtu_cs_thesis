Alright, you have now started the thesis. What do to next?

## The first month

The first month of the thesis depends a lot on the project you are doing. If the project is very well defined you will
find that you can start coding and analyzing data right away. However, in most cases you will need to spend some time
reading literature and getting a better understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. This is completely normal
and you should not be worried about it. In general expect to

1. Read literature

2. Begin analyzing data

3. Write

When you are closing in on the first month you need to hand-in a project plan.

## The project plan

You have two hand-ins during your thesis: a project plan precisely 1 month after starting the project and your thesis.
The project plan is a short document (2-3 pages) where you in more details describe what you are going to be doing
throughout the thesis. It is intended as a document to help you plan your work and to help your supervisor
understand what you are doing. In general the project plan should contain the following sections:

1. **Motivation**:
    The motivation for why you are doing this project. You should lay out the problem you are trying to solve and why
    it is important to spend time on solving this problem.

2. **Background**:
    The background of the project. You are never starting from scratch, so you should describe what current solutions
    look like and why they are not sufficient.

3. **Research question**:
    Most important part of the project plan. What is the overall research question you are trying to answer? You
    can have more than one, but try to keep it to a minimum. The research question should be specific and well defined,
    because in the end this is the question you should be answering with your thesis. Consider the
    [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) when writing the research question.

4. **Time plan**:
    A overall time plan for the project. This should be in the form of a
    [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) or similar. Include the different phases of the project and
    how long you expect each phase to take. As a bonus consider assigning each phase a risk level (low, medium, high)
    on how likely it is that you will be delayed in that phase. This is a good exercise to do, because it forces you to
    think about what can go wrong in each phase and how you can mitigate the risk of being delayed.

5. **References**:
    After the first month you should already have read a bunch of literature and including and references to this
    literature is a good idea. Literature should here be understood as anything you have read that is relevant to
    your project, either scientific papers, books, blog posts, technical documentation, videos etc.

The scientific method. When considering your research question you should consider the scientific method, namely that
your research question is essentially the hypothesis you are trying to prove or disprove.

Below are some examples of project plans from previous students.

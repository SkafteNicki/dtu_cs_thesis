## How long should the thesis be?

40-60 pages is a good rule of thumb, not including preface and appendix. You should include everything essential to your
thesis and nothing more. A shorter and condense thesis is in general to be preferred over a longer one.

## How many hours per week should I work on my thesis?

Officially you are a full time student when doing your thesis meaning that you should work 45 hours per week. That said,
nearly no one does that. From experience if you put in 25-35 hours per week or between 3-3Â½ days per week, you should be
able to finish your thesis with a good grade. A word of warning: the only failure case I have observed over the years,
is students that are not putting in enough hours into their project (due to various reasons) but the results is always
the same - a thesis that is rushed, incomplete, or lacking the necessary depth.

## Can I still have a student job while doing my thesis?

Yes, no problem. However, I would recommend talking with your employer about the last 2-3 weeks of your thesis and
either getting time off or reduced hours (if you economically can). The last weeks of your thesis is often the most
stressful, and you will need all the time you can get.

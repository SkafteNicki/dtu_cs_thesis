## How long should the thesis be?

40-60 pages is a good rule of thumb, not including preface and appendix. You should include everything essential to your
thesis and nothing more. A shorter and condense thesis is in general to be preferred over a longer one.

## How many hours per week should I work on my thesis?

Officially you are a full time student when doing your thesis meaning that you should work 45 hours per week. That said,
nearly no one does that. From experience if you put in 25-35 hours per week or between 3-3Â½ days per week, you should be
able to finish your thesis with a good grade.

# Doing a thesis at DTU Compute

First off, congratulations on reaching the point where you are writing your thesis! This document is intended to help
you through the three phases of doing a thesis at DTU Compute:

1. Preparation before starting the thesis,
2. Doing the actual thesis and
3. Finally writing and defending the thesis.

Each phase has its own challenges and this document is intended to help you through them.

Why does this documentation exist? Well, I have been supervising students writing their thesis at DTU Compute for a
couple of years now, and I have noticed that many students have the same questions and problems. This document is
intended to help you avoid some of the common pitfalls and answer some of the common questions. It is both incomplete
and opinionated, so please ask your supervisor for their opinion on the matter. Part of the documentation is based on
my colleagues writing on the same topic

For suggestions, corrections or comments, please create an issue on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_cs_thesis) and I get back to you as soon as possible.

I hope you have a wonderful time writing your thesis!

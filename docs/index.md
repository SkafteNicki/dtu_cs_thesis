# Doing a master thesis at DTU Compute

First off, congratulations on reaching the point where you are writing your thesis! This document is intended to help
you through the three phases of doing a thesis at DTU Compute: preparation before starting the thesis, doing the actual
thesis and finally writing and defending the thesis. Each phase has its own challenges and this document is intended to
help you through them.

Why does this documentation exist? Well, I have been supervising students writing their thesis at DTU Compute for a
couple of years now, and I have noticed that many students have the same questions and problems. This document is
intended to help you avoid some of the common pitfalls and answer some of the common questions. It is not a complete
so you should still ask your supervisor if you have any questions.

For suggestions, corrections or comments, please create an issue on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_cs_thesis) and I get back to you as soon as possible.

I hope you have a wonderful time writing your thesis!

Nicki

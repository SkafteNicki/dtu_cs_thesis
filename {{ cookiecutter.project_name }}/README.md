# Thesis template

This is a template for writing a thesis. It is generated from [this template](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_cs_thesis)
using [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is recommended when developing the thesis to
use the included developer container (devcontainer). This will ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the
code runs in a consistent environment.

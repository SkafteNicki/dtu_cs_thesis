This document is intended to help you through the three phases of doing a thesis at DTU Compute:</p> <ol> <li>Preparation before starting the thesis,</li> <li>Doing the actual thesis and</li> <li>Finally writing and defending the thesis. Each phase has its own challenges and this document is intended to help you through them.</li> </ol> <p>Why does this documentation exist? Well, I have been supervising students writing their thesis at DTU Compute for a couple of years now, and I have noticed that many students have the same questions and problems. This document is intended to help you avoid some of the common pitfalls and answer some of the common questions. It is both incomplete and opinionated, so please ask your supervisor for their opinion on the matter.</p> <p>For suggestions, corrections or comments, please create an issue on the GitHub repository and I get back to you as soon as possible.</p> <p>I hope you have a wonderful time writing your thesis!</p> <p>Nicki, Associate Professor at DTU Compute</p>"},{"location":"before/","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Before starting","text":""},{"location":"before/#finding-a-project","title":"\ud83d\udd0d Finding a project","text":"<p>The first step in writing a thesis is to find a project to work on. The four most common ways are:</p> <ol> <li>Find a project at a company, maybe where you are working as a student assistant</li> <li>Find a project through https://dtu.jobteaser.com</li> <li>Propose a project yourself</li> <li>Contact a professor or researcher at DTU for project ideas</li> </ol> <p>Regardless of what way you find a project, it is important that you find a project that you are interested in! You will be working on the project for 5+ months and burnout is a real thing. So, even if you are not in charge of formulating the initial project idea, you can still influence the project during the process to make it more interesting for you. Remember, in the end it is your thesis \ud83c\udf93</p>"},{"location":"before/#finding-a-supervisor","title":"\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Finding a supervisor","text":"<p>Regardless of how you find a project, you need a supervisor from DTU to register the project and guide you through the project (yes, also for company projects). The DTU rules state that:</p> <p> </p> <p>The main supervisor for a master's thesis must</p> <ul> <li> <p>Be an employee at DTU as a VIP with research obligations and one of the following job categories: assistant     professor, associate professor, researcher, senior researcher, senior adviser, or professor,</p> </li> <li> <p>Hold a permanent position (with the exception of assistant professors and researchers)</p> </li> <li> <p>Have completed DTU's course 'Supervision of larger projects at DTU' or similar pedagogical competence development     at the university level e.g. a course in PhD supervision; for assistant professors, however, it is sufficient     that one is in the process of UDTU, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Have in-depth knowledge of the study conditions at DTU.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So not all employees at DTU can be your main-supervisor. That being said, if you find a supervisor that does not meet the above criteria (PhD student, Postdoc or tenure-track assistant professor) it is possible that they can still supervise you, as long as you find a college that meets the above criteria to be your main-supervisor on paper.</p> <p>If you are doing a company project, you will also need a co-supervisor from the company. The co-supervisor does not officially hold any responsibilities, but they are very much expected to help you with the practicalities of the project and provide you with the necessary data and information.</p>"},{"location":"before/#read-the-rules","title":"\ud83d\udc53 Read the rules","text":"<p>Yes, it is super boring to read the rules, but it is important to know what you are getting into and you can often find questions to a lot of the questions you might have. So take your time to read them at least once. The rules may differ a bit from studyline to studyline, so make sure you read the rules for your studyline, which you can find here:</p> <p>https://student.dtu.dk/en/programme-specifications</p> <p>Especially, be aware of learning objectives for your thesis, as they are the basis for the assessment of your thesis. They will look something like this:</p> <p> </p> <p>A graduate of the MSc programme from DTU:</p> <ul> <li>can identify and reflect on technical scientific issues and understand the interaction between the various     components that make up an issue</li> <li>can, based on a clear academic profile, apply elements of current research at an international level to develop     ideas and solve problems</li> <li>masters technical scientific methodologies, theories, and tools, and can take a holistic view of and delimit a     complex, open issue, put it into a broader academic and societal perspective, and, on this basis, propose a     variety of * possible actions while considering sustainability</li> <li>can develop relevant models, systems, technologies, and processes aimed at solving technological problems</li> <li>can communicate and mediate research-based knowledge both orally and in writing</li> <li>is familiar with and can seek out leading international research within their specialist area.</li> <li>can work independently and reflect on own learning, academic development, and specialization</li> <li>masters technical problem-solving at a high level through cross-disciplinary teamwork, and can work with and     manage all phases of a project \u2013 including preparation of timetables, design, solution, and documentation</li> </ul> <p>All these learning objectives are fairly meta, but they can interpreted as you need to master every aspect of doing a thesis from the technical aspects to the communication and project management.</p>"},{"location":"before/#registering-the-project","title":"\ud83d\udcbe Registering the project","text":"<p>The project needs to be officially registered by your supervisor to DTU study administration.

Version control is such a critical part of code development that it is hard to overstate its importance. Version control allows you to track changes to your code over time, collaborate with others and manage different versions of your code. There are many version control systems available, but the most popular one is Git.

You handed in the thesis and you are only missing the defense. But what are the actual rules and format? Here is a short overview:</p> <p>The defense is a 1 hour examination of your project where you supervisor, co-supervisors if any, and a censor will be present. You are free to invite friends and family to the defense. The format is usually like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>20-25 min presentation of your project. You simply create a power-point or similar and present what you have done     throughout the project. You should more or less follow the structure of the thesis, but I would recommend that you     focus more on the parts of the project that is truly your work. By this I mean that you should not spend too much     time on the motivation and background but instead of your results and discussion. If you have a product to show,     like a demo of some software you have written, this should be included in the presentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>20-25 min of questions from censor and supervisor. Do not think of this part of the defense as a test. It is more     like a discussion where you either get questions to elaborate on your work or you get questions that are meant to     challenge your work. This is very much a discussion instead of you just answering questions.</p> </li> <li> <p>10 min of grading. You (together with friends and family) will be asked to leave the room and you need to take all     your belongings with you. Supervisor and censor then discuss what grade you should get. As a rule of thumb you can     expect that the majority of the grade is based on your report and the presentation is often used to determine which     grade you should get if you are on the edge between two grades.</p> </li> <li> <p>You get pulled in (without friends and family) and you are told the grade. You will most likely be given some     feedback for you to understand why you got the grade you got.</p> </li> </ol> <p>That's it. You are now either a Bachelor or a Master of Science.

Therefore, you are in principal free to use generative AI in your thesis as much as possible. However, you should be transparent about it. This means that you should disclose in the thesis that you have used generative AI. DTU follows the Vancouver Convention for citing AI-generated text.</p> <p> </p> <p>At submission, the journal should require authors to disclose whether they used Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u2013 assisted technologies (such as Large Language Models [LLMs], chatbots, or image creators) in the production of submitted work. Authors who use such technology should describe, in both the cover letter and the submitted work in the appropriate section if applicable, how they used it. For example, if AI was used for writing assistance, describe this in the acknowledgment section (see Section II.A.3). If AI was used for data collection, analysis, or figure generation, authors should describe this use in the methods (see Section IV.A.3.d). Chatbots (such as ChatGPT) should not be listed as authors because they cannot be responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the work, and these responsibilities are required for authorship (see Section II.A.1). Therefore, humans are responsible for any submitted material that included the use of AI-assisted technologies. Authors should carefully review and edit the result because AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete, or biased. Authors should not list AI and AI-assisted technologies as an author or co-author, nor cite AI as an author. Authors should be able to assert that there is no plagiarism in their paper, including in text and images produced by the AI. Humans must ensure there is appropriate attribution of all quoted material, including full citations.</p> <p>From the ICMJE guidelines</p> <p>Thus, in the appendix of your thesis you should add a section where you describe how you have used generative AI in your thesis. The most up-to-date guidelines regarding DTU rules regarding the use of generative AI can be found here</p>"}]}

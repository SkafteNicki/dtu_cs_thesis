The four most common ways are:</p> <ol> <li>Find a project at a company, maybe where you are working as a student assistant</li> <li>Find a project through https://dtu.jobteaser.com</li> <li>Propose a project yourself</li> <li>Contact a professor or researcher at DTU for project ideas</li> </ol> <p>Regardless of what way you find a project, it is important that you find a project that you are interested in! You will be working on the project for 5+ months and burnout is a real thing. So, even if you are not in charge of formulating the initial project idea, you can still influence the project during the process to make it more interesting for you. Remember, in the end it is your thesis \ud83c\udf93</p> <p>When considering project, think about what parts of computer science that you find most interesting. Very broadly, a thesis within computer science can be divided into four categories(1)</p> <ol> <li> Yes, this is a brute simplification of the field of computer science, but it is a good way to     think about what you find interesting and in my experience is still fairly covering.</li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Theory: This is the mathematical and theoretical part of computer science. It is about understanding the     fundamental limits of computation and algorithms. If you like math and theory, this is the place for you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software: This is about understanding and working with software. It is about understanding how to design, build     and maintain software. If you like programming and software development, this is the place for you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data: This is about understanding and working with data. It is about understanding how to store, process and     analyze data. If you like working with data, this is the place for you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modelling: This is about understanding and working with complex systems. It is about understanding how to model     and simulate systems. If you like understanding complex systems, this is the place for you.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You will most likely be working with a combination of these four categories, but it is a good idea to think about what you find most interesting. For example, if you are doing a project in the field of machine learning, you will most likely be working with data and modelling as the primary focus. That said, you can put more focus on software by implementing not just a model but a hole ML system and in the same way you can put more focus on theory by understanding the theoretical limits of the model you are using.</p>"},{"location":"before/#finding-a-supervisor","title":"\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Finding a supervisor","text":"<p>Regardless of how you find a project, you need a supervisor from DTU to register the project and guide you through the project (yes, also for company projects).

These dependencies are critical to your project, and you need to manage them properly. How you manage dependencies depends on the programming language you are using.</p> <p>Python</p> <p>In Python anno 2025 that are two main ways to manage and document your dependencies. Either you use pip together with a <code>requirements.txt</code> file or you use uv together with a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. Yes, there are other ways to manage dependencies in Python, but these are the ways I would recommend.</p> <p>As a example, we consider the case where we need to use <code>pandas</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> in our project.</p> pip + requirements.txtuv + pyproject.toml <p>Run the following command to install the dependencies:</p> <pre><code>pip install pandas scikit-learn\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>This will create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file that looks like this:</p> <pre><code>pandas==1.3.3\nscikit-learn==1.0\n</code></pre> <p>Run the following command to install the dependencies:</p> <pre><code>uv init\nuv add pandas scikit-learn\n</code></pre> <p>This will create a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file that contains the dependencies:</p> <pre><code>dependencies = [\n    \"pandas\",\n    \"scikit-learn\"\n]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"code/#code-documentation","title":"\ud83d\udcdd Code documentation","text":"<p>Undocumented code is code that does not run.</p> <p>Again, not technically true, but you get the point. Code documentation is critical to ensure that your code is usable by others (or your future self). There are many ways to document your code, but the most common way is to use a <code>README.md</code> file in the root of your project. This file should contain information about how to install and run your code. An example</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code># My awesome project\nTo run this project, you need to have Python X.Y or later installed. You can install the dependencies\nby running\n\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\nTo run the main experiments you can run the following command:\n\n`python main.py`\n\nafterwards to generate the plots you can run the following command:\n\n`python plot.py`\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to the <code>README.md</code> file, you should preferably also document your code using appropriate comments. The comments should explain what the code does, not how it does it. A good example is just adding docstrings to your functions/classes describing what they do.

You handed in the thesis and you are only missing the defense. But what are the actual rules and format? Here is a short overview:</p> <p>The defense is a 1 hour examination of your project where you supervisor, co-supervisors if any, and a censor will be present. You are free to invite friends and family to the defense. The format is usually like this:</p> <p>The censor &amp; and defense date</p> <p>Finding a censor is not your responsibility, it is your supervisors job. The censor is a external examiner (non-DTU person) that hopefully has some experience in the field of your project.</p> <p>The date of your defence date should take place no more than 2 weeks (10 working days) after you hand in your thesis. That said, it is not uncommon that a censor is not available and the defense is postponed a bit. You can make requests for the date, but in the end you need to be available for the date censor and your supervisor has time for. That said, if you have specific dates in mind talk with your supervisor early on.</p> <ol> <li> <p>20-25 min presentation of your project. You simply create a power-point or similar and present what you have done     throughout the project. Some advice to follow</p> <p>Slides</p> <ul> <li> <p>You should more or less follow the structure of the thesis, but I would recommend that you     focus more on the parts of the project that is truly your work. By this I mean that you should not spend too     much time on the motivation and background but instead of your results and discussion.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you have a product to show, like a demo of some software you have written, this should be included in the     presentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Never have more slides than minutes you have. 1 minute per slides is a good rule of thumb, that balance     not having slides that are way to complex and slides you just click through.</p> </li> <li> <p>The slides are there to support your presentation, not be the presentation. Therefore, make sure you are     not just reading the slides. Instead, add notes to the slides that you can use to remember what to say.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>20-25 min of questions from censor and supervisor. Do not think of this part of the defense as a test. It is more     like a discussion where you either get questions to elaborate on your work or you get questions that are meant to     challenge your work. This is very much a discussion instead of you just answering questions.</p> </li> <li> <p>10 min of grading. You (together with friends and family) will be asked to leave the room and you need to take all     your belongings with you. Supervisor and censor then discuss what grade you should get. As a rule of thumb you can     expect that the majority of the grade is based on your report and the presentation is often used to determine which     grade you should get if you are on the edge between two grades.</p> </li> <li> <p>You get pulled in (without friends and family) and you are told the grade. You will most likely be given some     feedback for you to understand why you got the grade you got.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Finally, you should not be nervous. You have done the work, and you know your project better than anyone else. Just be honest and open, and you will do fine.

This should be in the form of a     Gantt chart or similar. Include the different phases of the project and     how long you expect each phase to take. As a bonus consider assigning each phase a risk level (low, medium, high)     on how likely it is that you will be delayed in that phase. This is a good exercise to do, because it forces you to     think about what can go wrong in each phase and how you can mitigate the risk of being delayed.</p> </li> <li> <p>References:     After the first month you should already have read a bunch of literature and including and references to this     literature is a good idea. Literature should here be understood as anything you have read that is relevant to     your project, either scientific papers, books, blog posts, technical documentation, videos etc.</p> </li> </ol>  The scientific method.

This will make sure that the figures are of high quality and can be scaled to any size without loss of quality. In relation to this, if possible make sure that your figures are generated by code! Why is this? because you are most likely going to reproduce the figures multiple times. If you have a script that generates the figures, then you can easily reproduce the figures. Also, if the figure contains text, make sure that the text is approximately the same size as the main text.</p> <p>Finally, remember to refer to the figures in the text and describe it at least short details.

Therefore, you are in principal free to use generative AI in your thesis as much as possible. However, you should be transparent about it. This means that you should disclose in the thesis that you have used generative AI. DTU follows the Vancouver Convention for citing AI-generated text.</p> <p>Vancouver Convention</p> <p>At submission, the journal should require authors to disclose whether they used Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u2013 assisted technologies (such as Large Language Models [LLMs], chatbots, or image creators) in the production of submitted work. Authors who use such technology should describe, in both the cover letter and the submitted work in the appropriate section if applicable, how they used it. For example, if AI was used for writing assistance, describe this in the acknowledgment section (see Section II.A.3). If AI was used for data collection, analysis, or figure generation, authors should describe this use in the methods (see Section IV.A.3.d). Chatbots (such as ChatGPT) should not be listed as authors because they cannot be responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the work, and these responsibilities are required for authorship (see Section II.A.1). Therefore, humans are responsible for any submitted material that included the use of AI-assisted technologies. Authors should carefully review and edit the result because AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete, or biased. Authors should not list AI and AI-assisted technologies as an author or co-author, nor cite AI as an author. Authors should be able to assert that there is no plagiarism in their paper, including in text and images produced by the AI. Humans must ensure there is appropriate attribution of all quoted material, including full citations.</p> <p>From the ICMJE guidelines</p> <p>Thus, in the appendix of your thesis you should add a section where you describe how you have used generative AI in your thesis.

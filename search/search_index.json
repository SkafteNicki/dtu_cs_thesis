This document is intended to help you through the three phases of doing a thesis at DTU Compute:</p> <ol> <li>Preparation before starting the thesis,</li> <li>Doing the actual thesis and</li> <li>Finally writing and defending the thesis. Each phase has its own challenges and this document is intended to help you through them.</li> </ol> <p>Why does this documentation exist? Well, I have been supervising students writing their thesis at DTU Compute for a couple of years now, and I have noticed that many students have the same questions and problems. This document is intended to help you avoid some of the common pitfalls and answer some of the common questions. It is both incomplete and opinionated, so please ask your supervisor for their opinion on the matter.</p> <p>For suggestions, corrections or comments, please create an issue on the GitHub repository and I get back to you as soon as possible.</p> <p>I hope you have a wonderful time writing your thesis!</p> <p>Nicki, Associate Professor at DTU Compute</p>"},{"location":"before/","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Before starting","text":""},{"location":"before/#finding-a-project","title":"\ud83d\udd0d Finding a project","text":"<p>The first step in writing a thesis is to find a project to work on. The four most common ways are:</p> <ol> <li>Find a project at a company, maybe where you are working as a student assistant</li> <li>Find a project through https://dtu.jobteaser.com</li> <li>Propose a project yourself</li> <li>Contact a professor or researcher at DTU for project ideas</li> </ol> <p>Regardless of what way you find a project, it is important that you find a project that you are interested in! You will be working on the project for 5+ months and burnout is a real thing. So, even if you are not in charge of formulating the initial project idea, you can still influence the project during the process to make it more interesting for you. Remember, in the end it is your thesis \ud83c\udf93</p>"},{"location":"before/#finding-a-supervisor","title":"\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Finding a supervisor","text":"<p>Regardless of how you find a project, you need a supervisor from DTU to register the project and guide you through the project (yes, also for company projects). The DTU rules state that:</p> <p> </p> <p>The main supervisor for a master's thesis must</p> <ul> <li> <p>Be an employee at DTU as a VIP with research obligations and one of the following job categories: assistant     professor, associate professor, researcher, senior researcher, senior adviser, or professor,</p> </li> <li> <p>Hold a permanent position (with the exception of assistant professors and researchers)</p> </li> <li> <p>Have completed DTU's course 'Supervision of larger projects at DTU' or similar pedagogical competence development     at the university level e.g. a course in PhD supervision; for assistant professors, however, it is sufficient     that one is in the process of UDTU, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Have in-depth knowledge of the study conditions at DTU.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So not all employees at DTU can be your main-supervisor. That being said, if you find a supervisor that does not meet the above criteria (PhD student, Postdoc or tenure-track assistant professor) it is possible that they can still supervise you, as long as you find a college that meets the above criteria to be your main-supervisor on paper.</p> <p>If you are doing a company project, you will also need a co-supervisor from the company. The co-supervisor does not officially hold any responsibilities, but they are very much expected to help you with the practicalities of the project and provide you with the necessary data and information.</p>"},{"location":"before/#read-the-rules","title":"\ud83d\udc53 Read the rules","text":"<p>Yes, it is super boring to read the rules, but it is important to know what you are getting into and you can often find questions to a lot of the questions you might have. So take your time to read them at least once. The rules may differ a bit from studyline to studyline, so make sure you read the rules for your studyline, which you can find here:</p> <p>https://student.dtu.dk/en/programme-specifications</p> <p>Especially, be aware of learning objectives for your thesis, as they are the basis for the assessment of your thesis. They will look something like this:</p> <p> </p> <p>A graduate of the MSc programme from DTU:</p> <ul> <li>can identify and reflect on technical scientific issues and understand the interaction between the various     components that make up an issue</li> <li>can, based on a clear academic profile, apply elements of current research at an international level to develop     ideas and solve problems</li> <li>masters technical scientific methodologies, theories, and tools, and can take a holistic view of and delimit a     complex, open issue, put it into a broader academic and societal perspective, and, on this basis, propose a     variety of * possible actions while considering sustainability</li> <li>can develop relevant models, systems, technologies, and processes aimed at solving technological problems</li> <li>can communicate and mediate research-based knowledge both orally and in writing</li> <li>is familiar with and can seek out leading international research within their specialist area.</li> <li>can work independently and reflect on own learning, academic development, and specialization</li> <li>masters technical problem-solving at a high level through cross-disciplinary teamwork, and can work with and     manage all phases of a project \u2013 including preparation of timetables, design, solution, and documentation</li> </ul> <p>All these learning objectives are fairly meta, but they can interpreted as you need to master every aspect of doing a thesis from the technical aspects to the communication and project management.</p>"},{"location":"before/#registering-the-project","title":"\ud83d\udcbe Registering the project","text":"<p>The project needs to be officially registered by your supervisor to DTU study administration. In practice this should be done about two weeks before you start the work.

You do not fix the project description in stone, but it is a good idea to have a clear     idea of what you want to do.</p> </li> <li> <p>Number of ECTS: You can do the thesis for 30, 32.5 or 35 ECTS. The default is 30 ECTS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Start date: The date you start working on the project. If you start in the spring, you are expected to start     either in the first week of january or if you are having a 3 weeks course, then the first week after 3 weeks     period have ended. Similarly, if you start in the fall, you are expected to start in the first week of August or     the end of August depending on if you have a 3 weeks course in June. That said, you can register on alternative     days but you need to provide a reason for it.</p> </li> <li> <p>If company project please also provide:</p> <ul> <li>Company name</li> <li>Company address</li> <li>Company contact person</li> <li>Company contact email</li> <li>Company contact phone number</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Student information: Your student number and if it is a group project, the student number of your group     members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supervisor information: If you have more than one supervisor, you need to provide the email-initials of the     ones that are not registering the thesis.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that the title and description should be provided in both Danish and English.</p>"},{"location":"code/","title":"Code development during your project","text":"<p>Regardless of what your project scope is, you will need to write code.
